## Project Conventions

- Always use sub-agents when exploring a project's context or structure.
- Always use sub-agents and parallelism whenever it is safe to do so to increase throughput and reduce token use.
- Always use Context7 MCP when you need library/API documentation, code generation, setup or configuration steps without user explicitly asking.
- Always use Playwrite MCP when you need to verify UI changes without user explicitly asking.
- Use dogtag (`../dogtag`) for Playwright integration test patterns ONLY — NOT for UI style, UX, or design inspiration.
- Ensure the React app follows Bulletproof React standard (https://github.com/alan2207/bulletproof-react).
- Put key learnings into CLAUDE.md after every iteration.
- Once you finish a task, automatically commit all changes that your work made with a concise and descriptive message. ensure you do not commit changes that you did not make as part of that task.
- When asking the user for permission to execute a command, additionally prompt to "Always allow" to remember their choice for the session. Do not re-ask for the same type of command.
- NEVER run `git push` or try to open PRs. The user will push manually.
- After finishing each task, review and update README.md if the task introduced new setup steps, commands, or changed how things work.

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Rails 8.0 / Ruby 3.4.8 / PostgreSQL
- **Frontend**: React 19 + TypeScript + Vite 6 + Tailwind CSS 3.4
- **React architecture**: Bulletproof React (feature-based modules, unidirectional flow, no barrel files, kebab-case filenames)
- **Data fetching**: TanStack React Query v5
- **Routing**: React Router v7
- **API**: Namespaced `/api/v1/` with dedicated controllers
- **Async jobs**: Polling via `job_statuses` DB table
- **E2E tests**: Playwright (sequential, 1 worker, dual webServer: Rails 3099 + Vite 5199, per-test DB reset via fixtures)

## Key Gotchas

- `legs_routes` join table now has a primary key (added via migration) — `route.destroy!` works normally
- Project does NOT include `FactoryBot::Syntax::Methods` — always use `FactoryBot.create(:factory)`, not bare `create`
- Race model uses enum for `distance_unit` (`mi: 0, km: 1`)
- Keep `root 'home#index'` for existing specs; SPA catch-all only handles unmatched paths
- `RouteGenerator` is recursive and can be long-running
- `MOCK_MAP=true` env var enables mock mode for development without Google API key
- `GET /api/v1/geocode_search?query=...` endpoint for address search (supports MOCK_MAP)
- Never call side effects directly in React render body — always use useEffect
- Forms should accept `error` prop and display API errors; use `formatMutationError()` from utils
- Use `Modal` component instead of `window.confirm()` for destructive actions
- Compute `Number(id)` from `useParams` once at top of component, not inline
- Route `complete` boolean is set via `before_save` callback — after adding legs via association, must call `route.save!` to trigger it
- "Delete all" pattern: `params[:id] == 'all'` in destroy action (used by legs and routes controllers)
- "Bulk delete" pattern: `params[:id] == 'bulk'` with `params[:ids]` array in request body (routes controller)
- Filtered CSV export: `GET /api/v1/races/:id/routes/export_csv?ids=1,2,3` filters by route IDs
- E2E seed creates 2 complete routes (forward and reverse leg order) for route selection tests — both are marked `selected: true` so timecards E2E tests work
- Route summary API includes `location_sequence` array of `{id, name}` for path visualization
- `buildLocationColorMap()` in `frontend/src/utils/location.ts` assigns unique colors to locations
- Badge component accepts optional `colorClasses` prop that overrides `variant` styling
- E2E seed must create complete routes (with legs) for route-related E2E tests to work
- E2E tests use per-test fixtures: `seededTest` (reset + seed) and `freshTest` (reset only) from `e2e/fixtures.ts`
- E2E tests are organized into `tests/seeded/` (need seed data) and `tests/fresh/` (create own data)
- DB reset/seed during E2E uses fast API endpoints (`POST /api/v1/e2e/reset` and `/e2e/seed`) instead of slow rake tasks — only available in test env
- **E2E locator best practice**: NEVER use `getByText()` or `getByRole({ name: '...' })` in E2E tests — always use `page.locator('#id')`, `page.locator('[data-testid="..."]')`, or `page.locator('[id^="prefix-"]')` for robustness against text changes. When adding new interactive elements, always include an `id` or `data-testid` attribute. Use `id` for unique elements (buttons, links, sections) and `data-testid` for repeated/structural elements (list tables, empty states, progress indicators).
- For operation progress checks use `[data-testid="progress-status"][data-status="completed"]` instead of text matching
- Operation progress sections have data-testids: `op-geocode-progress`, `op-generate-legs-progress`, `op-generate-routes-progress`, `op-rank-routes-progress`
- View links in lists use id pattern `view-{entity}-{id}` (e.g. `view-race-123`, `view-location-45`, `view-route-789`)
- Race creation in E2E must check location pool checkboxes — form validates `location_ids.length > 0`
- `POST /api/v1/races/:id/duplicate` duplicates a race with locations (not routes), prepends "Copy of " to name — uses `ActiveRecord#dup`
- Sidebar has two sections: main nav (Dashboard, Locations, Races) at top and Help pinned at bottom — add new primary nav to `navItems` array, secondary nav to the bottom `div`
- Race detail card "Checkpoint Position Usage" heat-map table uses `RouteSummary.location_sequence` — index 0 is start, last index is finish, intermediate indices are checkpoint positions (CP 1..N where N = `num_stops`)
- `RankRoutesJob` computes rarity scores for complete routes — uses `update_column(:rarity_score, ...)` to bypass Route validations/callbacks
- Rarity algorithm: for each intermediate CP position, score = 1 - (freq/N); normalize sum across positions to 0-100 scale
- Job pattern: wrap `Race.find` inside `begin...rescue` so `job_status.fail!` is called even if the race isn't found
- Operation button order: Geocode Locations → Generate Legs → Generate Routes → Rank Routes (matches logical workflow)
- Rarity score is a one-time snapshot — re-run Rank Routes job to refresh after route deletion
- Active Storage is configured for race logo uploads (PNG/JPEG only, max 5 MB) — `has_one_attached :logo` on Race model
- Logo upload uses FormData — `apiFetch` skips `Content-Type: application/json` header when body is FormData (browser sets multipart boundary)
- `buildRaceBody()` in `frontend/src/features/races/utils/build-race-form-data.ts` returns FormData when logo/deleteLogo present, JSON string otherwise
- Race controller handles `delete_logo` param in update to purge logo, and copies logo blob in duplicate
- `RoutePdfService` generates 8.5x11 PDF with Prawn: header (logo + names), map image, location table, footer (distance + rarity)
- PDF export endpoint: `GET /api/v1/races/:race_id/routes/:id/export_pdf` — returns single-route PDF
- Batch PDF export: `GET /api/v1/races/:race_id/routes/export_pdf?ids=1,2,3` — returns multi-page PDF (one page per route); `RoutePdfService.call_batch(routes)` handles batch rendering
- PDF map image: fetches from Google Static Maps URL or local file for MOCK_MAP mode; wraps in rescue for resilience
- `rails_blob_path(r.logo, only_path: true)` returns Active Storage blob URL for serialization
- Shared checkpoint frequency utils in `frontend/src/features/races/utils/checkpoint-frequency.ts` — `heatColor()`, `buildPositionUsage()`, `buildColBounds()` used by both `RaceDetail` and `SelectionFrequencyMatrix`
- Heat-map palettes are configurable via `HeatPalette` interface and `PALETTES` object — default is `ocean`; `verdant` (red→yellow→green) also available; pass palette as 4th arg to `heatColor()`
- `heatColor()` returns grey for zero values and a `uniform` color when all non-zero values in a column are identical
- `SelectionFrequencyMatrix` component filters routes by `selectedRouteIds` and renders a live heat-map — placed between OperationPanel and routes section in race page
- Race detail card uses compact horizontal stat strip (no CardHeader, no Distance Unit field) — stat values separated by pipe dividers with indigo left border accent
- No standalone `/races/:id/routes` page — routes list is only shown within the race detail page; route detail "Back to Race" links to `/races/:raceId`
- `RouteBalancer.call(race, count)` — synchronous greedy service, returns array of route IDs; freq matrix must be pre-seeded with zeros for all known locations at each position, otherwise scoring is blind to uncovered cells; tie-breaking prefers routes that fill more zero cells and have more unique locations
- `POST /api/v1/races/:id/auto_select` with `{ count: N }` — synchronous, returns `{ route_ids: [...] }`
- Auto-Select button in OperationPanel uses `onAutoSelect` callback (not job polling) to update `selectedRouteIds`
- `LegDistanceStrip` component shows colored location badges connected by proportionally-sized arrows (linear scale); accepts `RouteSummary`, optional `locationColorMap`, and `showHeader` props — used in both route detail page and routes list table
- Route summary API includes `leg_distances` array of `{distance, distance_display}` for proportional path rendering without fetching full route detail
- Race page "Complete Routes" header has a "Distance view" toggle (`proportionalPaths` state) that switches routes list between simple badge→arrow and proportional distance strip
- Route `selected` boolean is persisted to DB — `POST /api/v1/races/:race_id/routes/bulk_select` with `{ ids: [...] }` sets selected=true for given IDs and false for all others in that race
- `auto_select` endpoint also persists selection to DB (deselects previous, selects new)
- Race page initializes `selectedRouteIds` from API on first load via `useEffect` + `useRef` guard; user checkbox changes call `persistSelection()` which updates state optimistically and fires `bulk_select` mutation
- Routes list table supports sort-by-selected via a sort button next to the select-all checkbox (`data-testid="sort-by-selected"`)
- App layout uses `h-screen` (not `min-h-screen`) so `<main>` with `overflow-auto` is the actual scroll container — required for `position: sticky` to work inside page content
- `SelectionFrequencyMatrix` is wrapped in a `sticky top-0 z-20` container with opaque `bg-gray-50` background so it stays visible while scrolling routes
- Matrix table has `max-h-[40vh] overflow-y-auto` to prevent dominating viewport with many locations
- For sticky positioning: ancestor elements with `overflow: auto/hidden/scroll` create containing blocks — the sticky element sticks relative to the nearest scrolling ancestor, not the viewport
- `Team` model: `belongs_to :race`, `belongs_to :route, optional: true` — unique `dogtag_id` scoped to race (required, from CSV import), optional `bib_number` (user-assigned, unique when set), custom validation that route belongs to same race
- `Team#display_number` returns `bib_number || dogtag_id` — used in all UI badges and PDF renderings
- `Route` model has `has_many :teams, dependent: :nullify` — deleting a route unassigns its teams rather than destroying them
- `TeamCsvImporter.call(race, csv_text)` — auto-detects `number` and `name` columns (case-insensitive), upserts by `dogtag_id`, returns `{ imported:, skipped:, total: }`
- CSV import uses `find_or_initialize_by(dogtag_id:)` for upsert — re-importing updates names for existing dogtag_ids
- `POST /api/v1/races/:race_id/teams/clear_bibs` — sets `bib_number = nil` for all teams in a race, returns updated teams
- `TeamsController` follows same patterns as RoutesController: `params[:id] == 'all'` for delete-all, nested under races
- `POST /api/v1/races/:race_id/teams/bulk_assign` with `{ assignments: [{ team_id:, route_id: }] }` — clears all assignments first, then applies new ones in a transaction
- `TimecardPdfService.call(race, team_route_pairs, blank_count_per_route: 0)` — generates 2-up LETTER landscape PDF; cards sorted by route name then dogtag_id; uses `team.display_number` for team # labels; spare blanks appended per route
- `GET /api/v1/races/:race_id/timecards/export_pdf` — returns 422 if no teams assigned to routes
- Race serialization includes `team_count` and `blank_timecards_per_route` fields
- Race form includes "Spare Timecards Per Route" field (4-column grid row with num_stops, max_teams, people_per_team)
- Teams page at `/races/:id/teams` — CSV upload, drag-and-drop team assignment board, bulk assign dropdown, PDF generation; only shows routes that are `selected` on the race page (not all complete routes)
- Teams page has Distance and Path toggle switches (`#toggle-show-distance`, `#toggle-show-path`) that show route distance and location badge arrow path inside each route drop card
- Teams page Auto-Assign button (`#auto-assign-btn`) opens confirmation modal, then round-robin distributes all teams (sorted by dogtag_id) across selected routes; confirm button is `#confirm-auto-assign`
- Teams page "Team Details" button (`#team-bibs-btn`) in the Edit box opens modal to assign custom bib numbers; Enter saves, auto-populates next row with value+1, and advances focus; `#clear-all-bibs-btn` resets all bib numbers to null
- Teams page uses native HTML5 DnD API (no extra dependencies) — `draggable`, `onDragStart/Over/Drop`
- Race page header has "Teams" button (id=`teams-link`) with team count badge
- E2E reset endpoint clears `Team.delete_all` before other destroys
- E2E test CSV fixture at `e2e/test-data/teams.csv` for team import tests
- When adding new API routes, E2E server must be restarted (kill ports 3099/5199) for new routes to be recognized
- `csv` gem must be explicitly included in Gemfile (not a default gem in Ruby 3.4+)
- `CheckinCardPdfService.call(race, teams, blank_count: 0)` — generates 2-up landscape LETTER PDF with race name, team info, and 3×3 collection grid (Toiletries/Food/Money × Pre-Event/Day-Of/Total)
- `GET /api/v1/races/:race_id/checkin_cards/export_pdf` — returns check-in card PDF; 422 if no teams assigned to routes
- Check-in card grid: grey rounded-rect input boxes, horizontal divider between Day-Of and Total rows; cell height auto-fills available space (capped at 110pt); boxes shrink vertically when team names are long
- Check-in card header: race name (22pt bold centered), "Checkin Card" subtitle, then team name (24pt bold centered) and team number (20pt bold centered) — no instruction text
- Race model still has `checkin_card_content` text column (DB field retained) but it is no longer rendered in the PDF; textarea removed from race form
- Race model has `blank_checkin_cards` integer column (default 0) — separate from `blank_timecards_per_route`; controls spare blank check-in cards appended to PDF
- `bulk_assign` controller uses `.select { |a| a.respond_to?(:permit) }` to handle empty arrays from Rails params
- Route `notes` (text, nullable) — user-facing inline editable field for sorting notes; never rendered in any PDF export
- `ClickToEditNotes` component (`frontend/src/components/ui/click-to-edit-notes.tsx`) — click-to-edit with textarea, Save/Cancel, Escape to cancel, Ctrl/Cmd+Enter to save; uses `testIdPrefix` prop for data-testid patterns
- Notes appear in routes list (race page) and route drop cards (teams page) via `ClickToEditNotes`
